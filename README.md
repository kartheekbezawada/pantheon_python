# Pantheon

**Pantheon** is a high-performance Python framework designed for building, testing, and debugging **ultra-low-latency systems** in high-frequency trading (HFT), real-time analytics, and low-level systems research.

> Prototype in Python → Deploy in Rust

---

## Purpose

Pantheon provides a Pythonic interface for:
- Simulating binary tick data streams
- Parsing and packing structured market messages
- Rapidly iterating on algorithms, signal detection, TTL filters, and queue logic
- Testing architecture plans (e.g. NemesisQ, Aura) before committing to Rust

---

## Philosophy

- **Python for Exploration**: Quick feedback loops, testing new ideas
- **Rust for Execution**: When nanoseconds matter, Rust takes over
- **Memory-First**: Struct-of-Arrays, cache-aligned layouts, and packed binary formats
- **Minimal Abstractions**: No bloated libraries—just performance-focused primitives

---

## Features

-  Quote message generator (randomized + binary packed)
-  Binary protocol definition with struct packing
-  Fixed-length messages (e.g., 184 bytes)
-  TTL, bitmask, and routing simulations
-  Byte-level diagnostics and logging
-  Cross-platform (develop on Windows/macOS, deploy to Linux)
